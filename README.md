# Pathfinding-Algorithms-visualizer
This projects implements all the informed searching algorithms.
Currently this project only implements the A-star pathfinding algorithm.

DEMONSTRATION:
1. TO run the demostration open the folder where the files are kept.
2. Open the terminal and run the Searching_AI.py file
(Type #python Searching_AI in the command line)
3. Keep clicking on the area to generate obstacles(red boxes).
4. You can press 'G' to enter goal mode in which you can set your desired position as goal mode.
5. Remember that you can only Put one destination or goal node in the maze. If you are in goal mode then click 'G' again will get you out of goal mode.
6. The initial position of the start node in the (0,0) or top left corner, which has been hard coded for now.
7. Whenever you have completed designing the maze Press 'Enter' to run the program.
